from window shrik a drive to make partation of unallocated space to install arch linux

download arch iso from https://archlinux.org/download/
and choose region india by <C-f>
create bootable pendrive and go into bios by tapping f2 as starting laptop

disable secure boot and also disable windows bit locker encryption maybe also disable fast boot
use iwctl to connect to wifi or ethernet
check using ping google.com
-iwctl
-device list
-device wlan0 scan
-device wlan0 show
-station wlan0 connect <wifiName> //press enter and type password for wifi
if sucessfully connect type exit to exit from iwctl-
and check via ping 

-pacman -Syu
-pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
-lsblk //to view the ssds and pendrive connect to system
-fdisk -l // to get the info about the storage that you want to install arch linux

create /mnt /boot for arch linux from unallocted space
use cfdisk /dev/<name of storage device form lsblk> //like nvme0n1 ,nvme1n1 --this are  based on slot on the motherboard

Time to create the partation from free space which is unallocated
create uefi partation from free space
-eg: Partition size: 800M //800mb for uefi press enter key to create it
then change the Type -> EFI System

create partation for linux from free space
-eg: Partition size: 180G //180 gb
then change the Type -> Linux file system

#skip if using archinstall
//create partation for swap form free space
//then change the Type -> Linux Swap

Write the change and type yes
and exit cfdisk
note: remeber the partation number of nvme_n_p_ of efi,mnt,swap

check the newly create partation 
-lsblk

Time to format the partation
partation are created now fomat them 
-mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme_n_p_ // uefi

-mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme_n_p_ //root , mnt 

#skip if using archinstall
//-mkswap /dev/nvme_n_p_  // swap 

Time to mount the partation
mount the root partaton
-mount /dev/nvme_n_p /mnt       //nvme_n_p is root,mnt which is biggest in storage size
-mkdir /mnt/boot
-mount /dev/nvme_n_p /mnt/boot //nvme_n_p is boot partation here i.e uefi 

#skip if using archinstall
-swapon /dev/nvme_n_p          //nvme_n_p is swap partation enable it virtual ram

veryfiy the partaion are mounted properly use
-lsblk

Time to install the arch linux 
-archistall
In disk configuration 
-pre-mounted configuration->
Enter the root dir of mounted devices : /mnt

choose mirror
set the root password 
set the usr with sudo access

Time to install the grub in boot partation in chroot env
-grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
-grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
exit from chroot env

-shutdown now //remove the bootable pendrive
